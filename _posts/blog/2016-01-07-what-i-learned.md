So here is my story, it all started when i learned to use **Adobe Photoshop**. And started designing web pages. It was so inspiring for me, that i was bound to turn those designs into code and bring them to the user hands. Then i started learning about **HTML**, at that time it was really confusing for me. Since i was using **tables** to structure my **layouts** :( it was so ugly and takes to much to load. Until i heard about **CSS**, and it was like someone showed me the **Ali baba's cave**. After that i was excited to learn about how to make beautiful **animations**. That's when **Javascript** entered in my life i remember the first time i made an element **fade in**, :smile: it was uplifting. I was craving for more so i started using **Jquery**.


**The story** didn't end here though, i noticed that my **projects** are all data **static pages**. a voice inside of me said, why wont make this more **dynamic**. I was attracted to **PHP**, started learning about it and about **Databases** henc **MYSQL**. And it shifted everything, i was finally able to manipulate data for the first time. Still something always seemed wrong to me, it was the pages **reloading** after each request. I am a **Gmail** user and i was so confused how it works so **seamlessly** and without refreshing the pages. It's when i discovered **AJAX** and **SPA** **(Single Page Application)**.


>But it's not just about learning right! :sunglasses:

I started a ongoing project called [Echooly](/project/echooly) as my graduation project. With a team of colleagues.
It was a **web based school management**, to help **students** and **teachers** collaborate. Basically i just wanted to help myself and other fellow students to be more in touch with their teachers and actually be more **productive**. I knew from the beginning, that it should be an **SPA** so i used **AngularJs** by **Google** as **front-end** framework and **Laravel** as a **PHP** **back-end** framework. Where i had the opportunity to learn more about **OOP (Object Oriented Programming)**.

> Of course when you talk about technology you have to mention mobile. :wink:

As an **Android** user, i really like it's ecosystem at least in point of view. So thanks to a **codelab** of **android** that were organized by **Algeria Developer Community** ,**GDG Algeria** & sponsored by **Condor, Djezzy**.

I learned a lot about **Android**, it was my first experience with **Java**.I got the opportunity to enroll in a contest **Algeria 3G Cup** that occurred after the codelabs. Where i built an application named [Rak Sure](/project/raksure-application) that helps to solve **math equations**, and answer questions about **scientific facts**. Which got me into the finals, competing with other ten **brilliant** finalists that i had the **honor** to meet and learned a lot from them.


**The End**
